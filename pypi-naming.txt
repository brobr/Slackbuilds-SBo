Just a suggestion here regarding any python packages that are distributed
via pypi. Any package there can be downloaded using this format:

https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/<package first letter>/<package name>/<package name-version.extension>

So, python-defusedxml would look like:

https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/defusedxml/defusedxml-0.6.0.tar.gz

Again, just a suggestion to try and make things a little easier.
